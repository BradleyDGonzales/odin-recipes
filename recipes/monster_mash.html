    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Monster Mash is one of the main foods eaten during the "vertical diet", introduced by Stan Efferding.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>90/10 Ground beef (or any other protein source - Ground chicken/turkey)</li>
        <li>White Rice (Easy to digest and clean source of carbohydrates)</li>
        <li>Spinach (Magnesium + Potassium)</li>
        <li>Chicken stock/Bone Broth (gut health)</li>
        <li>Optional ingredients:</li>
        <li>Cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>Red/Green Bell Peppers</li>
        <li>White potatoes</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Put 2.5 cups of White Rice into the Instapot, add 3 cups of water over the rice, add 1 cup of chicken
            stock/bone broth and stir</li>
        <li>I put about a Tablespoon of Ghee butter in the water after the rice. This is the brand of Ghee that I
            absolutely love and its in the baking isle at wegmans. (Make sure to get the Pink Himalayan Salt one!)</li>
        <li>I use about half of a bag of spinach, chop it up and put it on top of the water.</li>
        <li>I cut up half of the cherry/grape tomatoes container and put the first half on top of the spinach.</li>
        <li>Take 2.5 lbs of uncooked ground beef/chicken/turkey and make them into 6-7 meatballs. Place them on top of
            the spinach/tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Put the rest of the cherry/grape tomatoes on top of the meat. Add salt/pepper if you'd like!</li>
        <li>Close the lid and click the “White Rice” button. From here the Instapot will beep and start to warm up. Once
            it is warmed up it will beep again and should say “00:12” for 12 minutes of cooking. After the 12 minutes it
            will beep and the display will read “L0:00”. This is keeping the unit warm but no longer cooking. To keep it
            from getting to “soggy” I wait until the unit reads “L0:04”</li>
        <li>Release the pressure from the unit if needed.</li>
        <li>I take an oven mitt and hold onto the unit while I break up the meatballs and mix everything up. The meat
            may not look done but once you mix it up it will finish cooking and ready to go!</li>
